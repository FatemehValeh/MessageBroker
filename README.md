# MessageBroker
This is the final project of the Computer Networks course at The Amirkabir University of Technology.

A client can subscribe one topic or more or publish a message with a topic. The server sends the message published in a topic to all clients listening to that topic.

The full description of the project in Persian is available in the [description file](description.pdf). (In my implementation server doesn't ping a client.)
